Hey! If you reach this page, you're awesome. Now just edit the .md files (they're Markdown, just like TamsuiCM11), cause I don't know what to fill inside them.

And just for checking, here's some stuff.

[This is a link.](http://tamsuicm11.github.io)

- Unordered
- List

*Emphasized* and **bold** text.

1. Ordered
2. List
3. (Yes, it is in lower greek count - I can remove this if you want)

That's it, I guess. Delete all this if you want, I just put it here as sample content. :D
